                Built chatbots which can keep the consistency of different character speaking styles in the comedy South Park. Crawled the dialogues on the Internet with Scrapy. Used Glove for word embedding, and designed the persona vector. Pre-trained the persona-based text generation model with the global attention mechanism, beam search, scheduled sampling. Fine-tuned the base model by different characters, got different persona vectors by unfreezing them in self-designed LSTM.
