                Evaluated and optimized the Operating Room time utilization of UVA main facility with statistical modeling. Used ggplot2 to visualize the data, and did time series analysis to explore the overutilization problem. Used Structural Equation Model to select the best model for fitting multicollinearity of time data. Predicted the best management scheme with Monte Carlo Simulation to decrease the variability of overutilized time. Built 3D system simulation model with Simio to verify the scheme.
